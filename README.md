My Compound Interst Calculator!
Coder: Tessa Smigla


This web app is designed to compute the compound interest given:
    Principal: initial sum of money 
    Period: time interval for frequency of interest being calculated
    APR: annual percentage rate of interest
    Years: how long the interest continues to grow

With these four variables, this web can calculate the interest and the total sum, the interest added to the principal amount. The calculator solves for the total sum with the equation: 
    amount = principal * (1 + arp / period) ** (period * years)
With that, it can then calculate the interest by subtracting the original sum from the total sum.

The web app includes user inputs such as type, section options, and sliders. It then takes those inputs, converts them into values, and uses a calculate function to return the accumulated interest and total sum.
